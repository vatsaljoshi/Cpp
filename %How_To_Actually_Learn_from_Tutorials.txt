Below points and tips are my self tried and tested observations.

->WRITE THE CODE-
Don't just sit there and watch that tutorial like a movie instead write the code.Ultimately you are learning that concept to use that somewhere so use it as soon as you start getting it, even a little will be okay.

->YOU MUST KNOW WHERE THAT TUTORIAL WILL TAKE YOU-
Know and understand that why you are using that tutorial is it relevant,does it teach me all required?

->DO NOT CRAM-
Do not rush towards finishing that resource.Instead go at your own pace, learn everything that is being taught.

->THERE IS NO END TO ANYTHING.
So next time if you're learning something then do not just keep on scratching and scratching the thing instead learn only that much which will make you use that skill efficiently.

->DO NOT QUIT WHEN THINGS GET HARD IN THAT TUTORIAL.
No matter the quality of the tutorial you have to stick to it even if it becomes hard to do so.
