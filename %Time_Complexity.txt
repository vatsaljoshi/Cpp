/*
-Time complexity:it quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input.
-jaise jaise hamare input ka size change hoga toh waise waise kis prakaar hamare algorithm ka running time change hoga.
-Running Time-Linear , Quadratic, Cubic.
For example-
    suppose look at this below code-
        int n;
        cin>>n;
        int a=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            a+=1;
        }
        ->Now samajh ki iss loop main 'a' main sum kitni baar hoga, jitni baar loop run hoga? 
            for i=1,1->n 
                i=2,2->n...
        i.e. n times on a single run.So, by this we can deduce that the 'i' is directly proportional to 'n' so, its time complexity can be said to be linear.
    now look at this below code-
        int n;
        cin>>n;
        int a=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for (int j=1;j<=n;j++)
            {
                a+=1;
            }
        } 
        i=1,j=1 to n i.e. n times
        i=2,j=1 to n i.e. n times
        i=3,j=1 to n i.e. n times

        n times n run hoga that is n*n(Quadratic time complexity)

-Space complexity:it quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as an function of length of the input.
-In simple words, jo proram kam jagah lega aur phir bhi utna hi kaam karlega woh program efficient hain.
